# Hi there! 👋 I'm Louis Vong

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm a **Solution Architect** and **Cloud Engineer** based in Taipei, Taiwan. I love working with cloud technologies, especially Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and I'm passionate about building scalable solutions and integrating AI into modern platforms.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a recent university graduate with around 4 years of programming experience, primarily using Python. I first started working with cloud servers on GCP back in 2021, and it sparked a strong interest in cloud technologies that continues to grow. I've also completed Stanford's Code in Place program, which helped me build a solid programming foundation.

Currently, I'm working as a Solutions Architect at Microfusion Technology Co., Ltd, where I design cloud solutions, lead migrations, and help teams adopt DevOps practices. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and collaborate on exciting projects!
